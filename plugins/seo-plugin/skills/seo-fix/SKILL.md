# SEO Fix Skill

You are applying fixes for SEO issues identified by the seo-audit skill. You work from the `seo-report.json` file generated by the audit.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify that `seo-report.json` exists in the project root:

```bash
cat seo-report.json 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

If the file does not exist, inform the user they must run `seo-audit` first and stop.

## Input

The user may specify:

$ARGUMENTS

Supported inputs:
- **Issue ID**: `SEO-001` — fix a specific issue
- **Category**: `title`, `meta-description`, `headings`, `semantic-html`, `images`, `internal-links`, `rendering`, `gtm` — fix all issues in a category
- **"all"** — fix all auto-fixable issues
- **No input** — prompt the user to choose

## Fix Process

### Step 1: Load Report

```bash
node "SKILL_DIR/scripts/apply-fix.js" "$(pwd)" "<filter>" --dry-run
```

The `--dry-run` flag shows what would be fixed without making changes. Present this to the user for confirmation.

### Step 2: Apply Fixes

After user confirms, run fixes:

```bash
node "SKILL_DIR/scripts/apply-fix.js" "$(pwd)" "<filter>"
```

Where `<filter>` is the issue ID, category name, or "all".

### Step 3: Review Results

The script outputs a JSON result with fixed/skipped issues. Review each fix and verify it was applied correctly.

### Step 4: Generate Fix Report

The script creates `fix-report.md` in the project root with:
- List of fixed issues
- List of skipped issues (with reasons)
- Recommendations for manual fixes

## Fix Scripts

Category-specific fix scripts are available at:

- `scripts/apply-meta-fix.js` — Title and meta description fixes
- `scripts/apply-heading-fix.js` — Heading hierarchy fixes
- `scripts/apply-semantic-fix.js` — Semantic HTML fixes
- `scripts/apply-image-fix.js` — Image alt and component fixes
- `scripts/apply-link-fix.js` — Internal link fixes
- `scripts/apply-render-fix.js` — Rendering recommendations (NEVER auto-applies)
- `scripts/apply-gtm-fix.js` — Google Tag Manager installation and fixes

## Critical Safety Rules

1. **Rendering fixes are NEVER auto-applied.** The `apply-render-fix.js` script only outputs recommendations. Present these to the user and let them decide.

2. **Always show the user what will change** before applying fixes. Use `--dry-run` first.

3. **Back up files** before modifying them. The fix scripts handle this automatically.

4. **Verify fixes** after application. Read the modified files to ensure correctness.

5. If a fix would break functionality, **skip it** and note it in the fix report.

## Reference

See [reference/fix-strategies.md](reference/fix-strategies.md) for detailed fix patterns per category.

## After Fixes

1. Present `fix-report.md` summary to the user
2. List any issues that require manual intervention
3. Recommend re-running `seo-audit` to verify improvements
